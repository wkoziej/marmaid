# Epic 1.1: Setup projektu - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Establish a clean root-based frontend structure by migrating from the current `frontend/` subdirectory to root directory, creating the foundation for systematic frontend rebuilding while maintaining all existing quality standards and integrations.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Full React 19 + TypeScript application in `frontend/` subdirectory with comprehensive testing, quality gates, and Supabase integration
- Technology stack: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS 4, Vitest, Playwright, React Router, React Hook Form + Zod, Supabase
- Integration points: CI/CD workflows, Supabase client configuration, NPM workspace structure, testing infrastructure

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Migration from `frontend/` subdirectory structure to clean root-based structure (`src/`, `public/`, `tests/` in root)
- How it integrates: Root-level `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`, maintaining all existing tool configurations and quality standards
- Success criteria: Clean root structure with all existing functionality preserved, build and tests working, CI/CD pipeline updated

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Root Structure Migration** 
   - Move Vite + React + TypeScript configuration to root
   - Establish clean directory structure (`src/`, `public/`, `tests/`)
   - Update package.json and workspace configuration

2. **Story 2: Tooling Configuration Migration**
   - Configure TailwindCSS 4 in root
   - Setup ESLint + Prettier configuration in root
   - Migrate testing configuration (Vitest + Playwright) to root

3. **Story 3: Routing and Integration Setup**
   - Setup basic React Router in new structure
   - Ensure Supabase client integration works from root
   - Update build and development scripts

4. **Story 4: Unified Developer Dashboard**
   - Create compact developer information display consolidating git commit, environment, and database info
   - Implement expandable detailed view with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+D)
   - Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for development context sharing
   - Optimize developer/tester experience with responsive design and accessibility

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (Supabase client configuration maintained)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no database changes)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (maintaining existing component patterns)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (same build tools and configuration)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking CI/CD pipeline and development workflow during structure migration
- **Mitigation:** Parallel development approach - keep `frontend/` intact until root structure is verified working, update workflows incrementally
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to `frontend/` subdirectory structure by reverting git commits, restore original workflows

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing (all tests passing in new structure)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (Supabase, build tools, quality gates)
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately (README, development scripts)
- [x] No regression in existing features (comprehensive test coverage maintained)

---

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural documentation is required (infrastructure change only)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing patterns (same tools, same structure principles)
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable (configuration migration)

**Risk Assessment:**
- [x] Risk to existing system is low (parallel development approach)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (git revert + workflow restoration)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality (same test suite)
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (well-documented existing setup)

**Completeness Check:**
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable (root structure migration)
- [x] Stories are properly scoped (config migration, tooling, integration)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (tests pass, builds work, CI/CD updated)
- [x] Dependencies are identified (git, npm workspaces, CI/CD workflows)

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS 4 with comprehensive testing and CI/CD
- Integration points: NPM workspaces structure, CI/CD workflows (.github/workflows/multi-env-deploy.yml), Supabase client configuration, testing infrastructure (Vitest + Playwright)
- Existing patterns to follow: Maintain same tooling versions and configurations, preserve quality gates and coverage thresholds, keep same Supabase integration approach
- Critical compatibility requirements: All existing tests must pass in new structure, CI/CD pipeline must work without disruption, development and build scripts must function correctly
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact and that the migration preserves all current capabilities

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a clean root-based structure ready for systematic frontend rebuilding."
