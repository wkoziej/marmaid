# Epic 2: Client Management System

## Epic Goal

Enable therapists to efficiently create, manage, and organize client information and therapy history, replacing paper-based or memory-dependent client tracking with a structured digital system that improves continuity of care and reduces cognitive load.

## Epic Description

**Business Context:**
Therapists currently rely on memory or paper notes to track client information, therapy history, and treatment outcomes. This leads to inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and inconsistent care quality. A structured digital client management system will allow therapists to maintain comprehensive client records, quickly access historical data, and make informed decisions about treatment progression.

**User Value:**

- **Improved Client Care:** Access to complete therapy history enables better treatment planning
- **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Digital recall eliminates reliance on memory for client details
- **Professional Growth:** Structured data enables therapists to analyze what works and improve their practice
- **Time Efficiency:** Quick access to client information reduces session preparation time

**Technical Context:**
Building on the secure authentication foundation (Epic 1), this epic implements core client data management with Supabase database integration, ensuring secure storage and efficient retrieval of sensitive therapy practice information.
