# Epic 4: Intake Questionnaire System

## Epic Goal

Enable therapists to efficiently collect comprehensive client health information through digital intake forms, replacing paper questionnaires with a streamlined system that integrates client responses directly into their therapy profiles for informed treatment planning.

## Epic Description

**Business Context:**
Traditional paper-based intake questionnaires are time-consuming, prone to loss, and difficult to integrate with digital therapy records. Clients often complete forms in waiting rooms under time pressure, leading to incomplete or inaccurate information. A digital intake system allows clients to complete forms at their convenience while ensuring therapists receive comprehensive, legible information before the first session.

**User Value:**

- **Therapist Efficiency:** Digital intake data automatically integrates with client profiles, eliminating manual data entry
- **Client Convenience:** Clients complete forms at home at their own pace, leading to more thoughtful responses
- **Improved Care Quality:** Comprehensive intake information enables better-informed first sessions and treatment planning
- **Professional Presentation:** Digital forms enhance the modern, professional image of the therapy practice
- **Data Accuracy:** Validation and required fields ensure complete, accurate information collection

**Technical Context:**
This epic implements a hybrid approach for faster MVP rollout: initial integration with external form services (Google Forms/Typeform) for immediate deployment, with a roadmap for native in-app forms in future releases. The system integrates with client management (Epic 2) to ensure intake data becomes part of the comprehensive client record.
