# Epic 3: Therapy Planning & Tracking

## Epic Goal

Enable therapists to plan, execute, and track marma point therapies with visual guidance, multi-school support, and detailed session documentation, transforming marma therapy practice from memory-based to data-driven professional treatment.

## Epic Description

**Business Context:**
Marma point therapy involves complex anatomical knowledge, precise point locations, and varied therapeutic approaches across different schools of practice. Currently, therapists rely on memory, paper charts, or basic anatomical references, leading to inconsistencies and missed therapeutic opportunities. This epic delivers the core differentiator of Marmaid: comprehensive marma-specific therapy planning and tracking tools.

**Therapeutic Value:**

- **Precision Enhancement:** Visual marma point references eliminate guesswork and improve treatment accuracy
- **School Adaptation:** Support for different marma therapy schools enables therapists to apply their specific training
- **Treatment Optimization:** Session tracking reveals what works for individual clients, improving outcomes
- **Professional Development:** Detailed documentation supports therapist learning and technique refinement
- **Client Safety:** Systematic tracking prevents over-treatment of specific points and ensures balanced therapy

**Technical Context:**
This epic represents the most specialized component of Marmaid, requiring custom marma point databases, visualization systems, and therapy-specific tracking mechanisms. It integrates with client management (Epic 2) to provide comprehensive therapy planning within individual client contexts.
