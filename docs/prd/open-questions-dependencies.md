# Open Questions & Dependencies

## Open Questions

1. **Database Choice (Long-Term)**: Supabase confirmed for MVP. Should we later commit to **Supabase Pro** for stability, or explore alternatives (PocketBase, self-hosted Postgres)?
2. **Visualization Source**: Decided to use **custom graphics / 3D models** for marma points visualization.
3. **Therapist–Client Interaction**: What would client access involve? → Likely requires additional authentication layers, secure client portal, and clearer privacy rules.
4. **Intake Questionnaire Format**: For faster rollout, integrate with an external service (e.g., Google Forms/Typeform) initially, migrate to in-app forms later.
5. **Regulatory Needs**: Data compliance (e.g., HIPAA) postponed to later phases.

## Dependencies

- GitHub Pages + Supabase availability and free plan limits.
- Access to quality visuals/3D models of marma points.
- Willingness of early therapists to test MVP and provide feedback.
- UX clarity for switching between marma schools and visual point mapping.
