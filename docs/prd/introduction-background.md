# Introduction & Background

This project aims to deliver a **web-based application called _Marmaid_** that supports marma point therapists in managing clients, planning therapies, and tracking progress. The application addresses the common problem of therapists relying on memory or paper notes, which leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities in treatment.

_Marmaid_ will allow therapists to maintain structured client records, adapt therapy plans according to different schools of marma therapy, and collect intake data digitally. In addition, the application will provide therapists with **access to information about marma points along with their visualization on the human body**, ensuring more accurate and professional therapy planning.

By doing so, _Marmaid_ reduces cognitive load, improves session continuity, and enhances the professional presentation of therapy practices. Over time, the app can also evolve into a communication bridge between therapist and client.
