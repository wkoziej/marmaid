# Epic 5: Deployment & Infrastructure

## Epic Goal
Establish robust, scalable deployment pipelines and infrastructure that enable secure, reliable delivery of Marmaid application to test and production environments with proper CI/CD automation, monitoring, and operational excellence.

## Epic Description

**Business Context:**
As Marmaid evolves from development to production, we need professional deployment infrastructure that ensures reliable service delivery, data protection, and seamless user experience. Therapists depend on consistent, secure access to their practice management tools, making robust infrastructure critical for business success.

**Technical Context:**
Building on our React + Supabase foundation (Epic 1), this epic establishes the deployment pipeline and infrastructure needed to deliver features from subsequent epics (Client Management, Therapy Planning) safely and reliably to end users.

**Success Criteria:**
- Test environment enables continuous validation of new features
- Production environment delivers reliable, secure service to therapists
- CI/CD pipeline automates deployment with quality gates and safety measures
- Monitoring and observability provide operational insight and rapid incident response
- Infrastructure scales with user growth and feature expansion

## Stories

### 5.1 Test Environment Setup & CI/CD Pipeline
- **User Story:** *As a development team*, we need a dedicated test environment with automated deployment pipeline so that we can continuously validate features before production release.
- **Key Features:**
  - Supabase test project with isolated data
  - Automated deployment from develop branch  
  - Test data seeding and environment configuration
  - Branch preview deployments for feature validation
  - Automated test execution (unit, integration, E2E)

### 5.2 Production Infrastructure & Deployment
- **User Story:** *As a therapist user*, I need reliable, secure access to Marmaid application so that I can manage my practice without service disruptions or data concerns.
- **Key Features:**
  - Production Supabase project with security hardening
  - CDN-hosted frontend with custom domain and SSL
  - Database backup and disaster recovery procedures  
  - Production-grade monitoring and error tracking
  - Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases

### 5.3 Security & Compliance Infrastructure  
- **User Story:** *As a practice owner*, I need assurance that my client data is protected by enterprise-grade security so that I can confidently store sensitive therapy information.
- **Key Features:**
  - Security scanning and vulnerability management
  - Compliance logging and audit trails
  - Secrets management and environment isolation
  - Database encryption and access controls
  - Security incident response procedures

### 5.4 Monitoring, Observability & Operations
- **User Story:** *As a platform operator*, I need comprehensive monitoring and alerting so that I can proactively maintain service quality and rapidly respond to issues.  
- **Key Features:**
  - Application performance monitoring (APM)
  - Infrastructure metrics and alerting
  - Error tracking and user impact analysis
  - Uptime monitoring and SLA tracking
  - Operational runbooks and incident response

## Acceptance Criteria

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Test Environment:** Fully functional test environment with automated deployments enables continuous feature validation
2. **Production Reliability:** Production environment delivers 99.9% uptime with sub-3-second response times
3. **Security Posture:** Infrastructure meets healthcare-adjacent security standards with encryption, access controls, and audit logging
4. **Operational Excellence:** Comprehensive monitoring provides visibility into system health with proactive alerting
5. **Deployment Safety:** CI/CD pipeline includes quality gates, automated testing, and safe rollback capabilities

## Technical Dependencies
- Epic 1 completion (Authentication & Foundation) - **PREREQUISITE**
- Supabase Pro plan for production workloads
- Domain registration and SSL certificate management
- CDN service (Vercel/Netlify) for global content delivery
- Monitoring service (DataDog/New Relic) for observability
- Security scanning tools integration

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Production deployment issues could impact therapist users
- **Mitigation:** Blue-green deployments, comprehensive testing, gradual rollout strategy
- **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in infrastructure could expose sensitive data  
- **Mitigation:** Security scanning, compliance frameworks, regular security audits
- **Risk:** Infrastructure costs could escalate with user growth
- **Mitigation:** Resource monitoring, auto-scaling policies, cost optimization reviews

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test environment operational with automated CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Production environment delivering reliable service with monitoring
- [ ] All four stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Security hardening implemented with compliance logging
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting functional with defined SLAs  
- [ ] Operational runbooks documented for incident response
- [ ] Infrastructure cost optimization implemented
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures tested and validated

## Story Sequencing & Dependencies
1. **5.1 Test Environment** - Foundation for all subsequent development
2. **5.2 Production Infrastructure** - Depends on 5.1 completion
3. **5.3 Security & Compliance** - Can be parallel to 5.2 with coordination
4. **5.4 Monitoring & Operations** - Final layer, depends on 5.2 completion
