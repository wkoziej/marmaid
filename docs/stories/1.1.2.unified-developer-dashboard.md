# Story 1.1.2: Unified Developer Dashboard

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer or tester,
**I want** a unified, accessible developer information dashboard on the landing page that consolidates git commit, environment, database, and build information in a compact format,
**so that** I can quickly identify which deployment environment I'm working with and access comprehensive development context without navigating through multiple information sources.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Replace the current verbose version information display with a compact developer info header line
2. Create an expandable detailed view for comprehensive development context (toggle-based)
3. Remove "Go to Application" button based on frontend readiness
4. Ensure all developer information is accessible via data-testid attributes for E2E testing
5. Maintain responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile testing devices

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create compact developer info header component (AC: 1)
  - [x] Design single-line format: `ðŸ”§ DEV: v.{commit} | {env} | {dbinfo} `
  - [x] Replace existing verbose version-info section with compact header
  - [x] Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all information sources
  - [x] Add data-testid attributes following coding standards

- [x] Task 2: Update testing suite (AC: 6)
  - [x] Update all existing tests to use new data-testid attributes
  - [x] Add tests for keyboard shortcut functionality
  - [x] Test expandable view toggle behavior
  - [x] Ensure responsive design testing coverage

- [x] Task 7: Responsive design implementation (AC: 7)
  - [x] Ensure compact header works on mobile devices
  - [x] Test expandable view on different screen sizes
  - [x] Optimize information density for small screens

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.1.root-structure-migration.md#dev-agent-record]

- **Current Implementation**: Landing page with verbose version information display showing 6 separate lines
- **Git Information**: Build-time injection working via Vite with **GIT_INFO** global
- **Environment Detection**: Working logic for Development/Test/Production based on branch and environment variables
- **Database Environment**: Dynamic detection working for Local Development/Test Database/Production Database
- **Testing Standards**: All interactive elements use data-testid attributes following coding standards

### Relevant Source Tree Information

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-project-structure]
**Root Structure (Post-Migration):**

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/               # UI shared components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/                  # shadcn/ui base components
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                     # Utilities, helpers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.ts            # General utilities (cn() function)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ constants.ts        # App constants
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx                 # Landing page component (current implementation)
â”œâ”€â”€ App.test.tsx           # Landing page tests
â””â”€â”€ main.tsx               # App entry point
```

### Component Development Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#react-standards]

- **Component Definition**: Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- **Props Typing**: Explicit TypeScript interfaces, no `any` types allowed
- **State Management**: useState for local component state
- **Event Handlers**: Properly typed event handlers with TypeScript

### Styling Standards Implementation

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#styling-standards]

- **CSS Framework**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui component library
- **Class Utility**: Use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive prefixes
- **Component Styling**: Follow shadcn/ui patterns for consistent design

### Current Git Information Injection

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.1.root-structure-migration.md#build-and-development-process]
**Build-time Injection Pattern:**

```typescript
// vite.config.ts already configured with git info injection
const gitInfo = (
  globalThis as typeof globalThis & { __GIT_INFO__?: typeof __GIT_INFO__ }
).__GIT_INFO__ ||
  __GIT_INFO__ || {
    commit: 'unknown',
    branch: 'unknown',
    date: 'unknown',
  };
```

### Environment Detection Logic

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.1.root-structure-migration.md#database-environment-detection]
**Database Environment Detection:**

```typescript
const getDatabaseEnv = (url: string) => {
  if (url === 'Not configured') return 'Local Development';
  if (url.includes('myxicttnpflkwnofbhci')) return 'Test Database';
  if (url.includes('aajurxtbngbixsdptfzz')) return 'Production Database';
  return 'Unknown Database';
};
```

### Component Integration Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#core-dependencies]
**Technology Stack for Component:**

- React 19 functional components
- TypeScript with strict typing
- Vite build system (already configured)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- No additional dependencies required

### Testing

#### Test Attribute Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

- **Selector Standard**: Use `data-testid` attributes for all interactive elements
- **Naming Convention**: kebab-case format (e.g., `data-testid="dev-info-toggle-button"`)
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + @testing-library/react for component tests
- **File Location**: Tests co-located with components in same directory

#### Component Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#component-testing]

```typescript
// âœ… DO: Use data-testid for stable selectors
<button data-testid="dev-info-toggle-button">
<div data-testid="dev-info-compact-header">
<div data-testid="dev-info-detailed-view">
<button data-testid="dev-info-copy-button">

// âœ… DO: Test user interactions, not implementation
await userEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('dev-info-toggle-button'))
expect(screen.getByTestId('dev-info-detailed-view')).toBeVisible()
```

#### Test Coverage Requirements

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.1.root-structure-migration.md#testing-standards]

- **Unit Tests**: Component behavior, state management, event handling
- **Keyboard Testing**: Ctrl+D shortcut functionality
- **Responsive Testing**: Mobile and desktop viewport testing
- **Clipboard Testing**: Copy functionality with mocked clipboard API
- **Environment Testing**: Different environment variable scenarios

#### Test Environment Compatibility

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.1.root-structure-migration.md#environment-specific-testing]

- **CI Compatibility**: Tests must pass in GitHub Actions CI environment
- **Environment Variables**: Tests should handle different VITE\_\* configurations
- **Global Variables**: Mock **GIT_INFO** appropriately for consistent test results
- **Browser APIs**: Mock clipboard API for cross-environment compatibility
