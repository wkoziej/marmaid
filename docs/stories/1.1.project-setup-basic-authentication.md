# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic Authentication

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** therapist,
**I want** to register and log into a secure therapy practice management system,
**so that** I can access and manage my professional therapy practice data with proper authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **React Foundation**: Application uses Vite + React 18 with TypeScript for the foundational setup
2. **Authentication System**: Supabase-based authentication system with email/password registration and login

## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack

[Source: docs/architecture/2-dobr-technologii-i-bibliotek-mvp.md]

**Frontend Build**: Vite + React 18 for fast development and build process
**UI Framework**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for consistent, professional component system  
**Routing**: React Router for SPA navigation
**Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for cache and Supabase synchronization
**State Management**: Zustand for lightweight local state management
**Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod for validation and developer experience
**Authentication & Database**: @supabase/supabase-js + optional @supabase/auth-ui-react for auth flows

### Frontend Architecture Structure

[Source: docs/architecture/3-frontend-architecture.md]

```
src/
  app/               # routing, layout
  components/        # UI shared components (shadcn/ui)
  features/
    auth/            # authentication: login, registration, password reset
  lib/               # supabase client, helpers, auth guards
  styles/            # tailwind.css
```

**Key Patterns**:

- Protected routes with authentication guards - only authenticated users can access app data
- React Query for Supabase synchronization (useQuery/useMutation patterns)
- React Hook Form + Zod for form schemas and validation
- Shared validation schemas between frontend and backend where possible

### Authentication & Security Implementation

[Source: docs/architecture/5-authentication-security.md]

**Authentication Flow**: Supabase Email/Password authentication (magic link/OAuth as future enhancement)
**Password Reset**: Built-in Supabase flow - email + token-based password update with in-app reset screen
**User Roles**: 'therapist', 'client' (future), 'admin' (internal) - start with therapist role
**Security**: TLS in transit via Supabase, consider field-level encryption for sensitive therapy notes in future
**Data Region**: Prefer EU region in Supabase for RODO/GDPR compliance with data retention and export policies

### Deployment Configuration

[Source: docs/architecture/10-deployment-hosting.md]

**Frontend Hosting**: GitHub Pages with CI workflow (Vite build → deploy)
**Supabase Setup**: EU region project with Edge Functions deployment via CLI, Database Migrations via supabase db/SQL
**Monitoring**: Supabase logs for DB/Functions, potential Sentry integration for frontend error tracking

**Environment-Specific Configuration**:

- **Local Environment**: Development Supabase project, local environment variables, hot reload development server
- **Test Environment**: Dedicated test Supabase project, automated database migrations in CI/CD, isolated test data
- **Production Environment**: Production Supabase project, secure environment variables, automated deployments with rollback capability

**CI/CD Migration System**:

- Database migration automation for test and production environments
- Migration validation in test environment before production deployment
- Rollback procedures for failed migrations
- Environment-specific migration scripts and data seeding

### Coding Standards for Implementation

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**TypeScript**: Explicit interface definitions, avoid 'any' type, use type unions for constants, proper return types for async functions
**React Components**: Functional components with TypeScript, proper props interfaces, custom hooks for business logic
**Zustand State**: Typed stores with explicit interfaces for state management
**Form Implementation**: Zod schemas with z.infer<> for type generation, React Hook Form with zodResolver
**Styling**: Use cn() utility for conditional classes, Tailwind layers for CSS organization
**Error Handling**: Error boundaries for graceful failures, proper async error handling with try/catch
**Testing**: Use data-testid attributes for stable E2E test selectors, test user interactions not implementation details

### Project Structure Alignment

Files should be created according to the frontend architecture structure:

- Authentication components in `src/features/auth/`
- Shared UI components in `src/components/`
- Supabase client and auth utilities in `src/lib/`
- Main application routing in `src/app/`

### Testing

**Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with components using `.test.tsx` suffix
**Testing Standards**:

- Use data-testid attributes for stable selectors in E2E tests
- Component testing with @testing-library/react for user interactions
- Unit tests for authentication service functions and business logic
- Test error states and loading states for authentication flows
- E2E tests should use getByTestId() instead of language-dependent selectors

**E2E Testing Requirements**:

- Complete authentication flows: registration → login → logout → password reset
- Cross-browser testing for authentication compatibility
- Test environment isolation with separate Supabase test database
- Automated E2E test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Professional UX validation in E2E tests (loading states, error messages, form validation)

**Environment-Specific Testing**:

- **Local**: Development database, hot reload, debug mode
- **Test**: Isolated test database, automated CI/CD testing, migration validation
- **Prod**: Production database, performance monitoring, error tracking

**Testing Frameworks**: Standard React testing patterns with @testing-library/react for component tests, Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing with data-testid selectors.
