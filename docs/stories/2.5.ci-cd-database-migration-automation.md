# Story 2.5: CI/CD Database Migration Automation - Brownfield Addition

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** automated, reliable database migration execution with proper error handling and rollback capabilities in the CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** deployments are consistent, environments stay synchronized, and deployment failures due to migration issues are eliminated.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing GitHub Actions workflow (multi-env-deploy.yml), Supabase CLI migration system
- Technology: Supabase CLI v2.39.2, GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL migrations
- Follows pattern: Current CI/CD deployment process with test/production environment separation
- Touch points: Multi-environment deployment workflow, Supabase project linking, migration files in `/supabase/migrations/`

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Migration execution includes pre-flight validation and dependency checking
2. Failed migrations trigger automatic rollback to previous state
3. Migration status is verified post-execution with detailed logging
4. Environment synchronization verification between test and production

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing multi-environment deployment workflow continues to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing GitHub Actions pattern for error handling
7. Integration with Supabase CLI maintains current behavior for successful migrations

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Migration automation is covered by workflow tests and validation steps
9. Documentation is updated to reflect enhanced migration process
10. No regression in existing deployment functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Enhance existing migration steps in multi-env-deploy.yml workflow with validation, rollback, and verification phases
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Current Supabase CLI integration (lines 118-130, 235-247 in multi-env-deploy.yml)
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain existing environment separation (test/production), preserve current secret management approach

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Migration pre-flight validation implemented
- [ ] Automatic rollback mechanism for failed migrations
- [ ] Post-migration verification and status reporting
- [ ] Enhanced error logging and debugging information
- [ ] Environment synchronization checks
- [ ] Existing deployment workflow regression tested
- [ ] Updated documentation for enhanced migration process

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Migration rollback could fail, leaving environment in inconsistent state
- **Mitigation:** Implement database state backup before migration execution and comprehensive validation
- **Rollback:** Database snapshot restoration and deployment rollback to previous commit

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing workflow triggers and environment variables
- [ ] Database changes are handled through existing migration file pattern
- [ ] No changes to current Supabase project linking approach
- [ ] Performance impact limited to deployment phase only

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Migration Pre-flight Validation** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add migration dependency validation step
  - [ ] Implement database connectivity verification
  - [ ] Add migration file syntax validation
  - [ ] Create migration sequence validation

- [ ] **Task 2: Enhanced Error Handling and Rollback** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement automatic rollback on migration failure
  - [ ] Add database state backup before migrations
  - [ ] Create rollback verification and reporting
  - [ ] Add failure notification mechanism

- [ ] **Task 3: Post-Migration Verification** (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Implement migration status verification
  - [ ] Add database schema validation
  - [ ] Create environment synchronization checks
  - [ ] Enhanced logging for migration process

- [ ] **Task 4: Integration and Testing** (AC: 8, 10)
  - [ ] Update existing workflow with enhanced migration steps
  - [ ] Add workflow validation for migration enhancements
  - [ ] Test rollback scenarios in test environment
  - [ ] Verify no regression in existing deployment process

## Dev Notes

**Current Migration Implementation:**

- Located in `.github/workflows/multi-env-deploy.yml`
- Uses Supabase CLI v2.39.2 for migration execution
- Separate steps for test (lines 118-130) and production (lines 235-247)
- Current command: `supabase db push --include-all -p $SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`

**Existing Project Structure:**

- Migration files: `/supabase/migrations/`
- Configuration: `/supabase/config.toml`
- Environment separation: test.marmaid.pl and marmaid.pl (production)

**Integration Points:**

- GitHub Secrets: SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN, SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD, SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
- Environment Variables: Different for test vs production environments
- Workflow Dependencies: quality-gates job must pass before migration execution

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**

- Test file location: Workflow validation in `.github/workflows/`
- Test standards: Must verify rollback scenarios and migration validation
- Testing frameworks: GitHub Actions workflow testing, Supabase CLI validation
- Specific requirements: Test both successful and failed migration scenarios in test environment
