# Story 1.1.3: Routing and Integration Setup

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to setup basic React Router in the new root structure and ensure Supabase client integration works from root directory with updated build and development scripts,
**so that** we have a working SPA routing foundation and backend integration ready for feature implementation while maintaining all existing quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Install and configure React Router DOM in root structure with proper TypeScript configuration
2. Create basic routing structure in src/app/router.tsx with authentication-aware route guards
3. Setup Supabase client configuration in src/lib/supabase.ts with proper environment variables
4. Update build and development scripts to work correctly with React Router and Supabase integration
5. Verify routing works correctly in development and production builds with browser history API
6. Ensure all existing tests pass and CI/CD workflows work with new routing and integration setup
7. Create basic layout structure and navigation scaffolding for future feature implementation

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

[Source: docs/architecture/3-frontend-architecture.md]
**Routing Requirements:**

- **Protected routes** with auth guards - access to data only after login
- **Feature-based routing** following feature module structure:
  - `/auth/*` - Authentication (login, register, reset)
  - `/clients/*` - Client management and intake preview
  - `/sessions/*` - Session logging and notes
  - `/planning/*` - Therapy planning and point selection
  - `/dashboard` - Main dashboard after login

**State Management Integration:**

- React Query for server state synchronization with Supabase
- Route guards for authentication state management
- Feature module isolation with routing boundaries

### Supabase Integration Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/4-backend-database-supabase.md]
**Client Configuration:**

- Environment variables: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- TypeScript integration with Database types
- Auth integration for protected routes
- Multiple environment support (local/test/prod)

**Environment Scripts Integration:**
[Source: package.json analysis]

- `npm run env:test` - Switch to test Supabase environment
- `npm run env:prod` - Switch to production Supabase environment
- `npm run env:local` - Switch to local development environment

### File Naming and Import Conventions

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Component Standards:**

- **Components**: PascalCase (`Router.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAuth.ts`)
- **Services**: camelCase (`supabaseClient.ts`)
- **Utils**: camelCase (`authGuards.ts`)

**Import Standards:**

```typescript
// Absolute imports from src root
import { Router } from '@/app/router';
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';
import { ProtectedRoute } from '@/lib/auth-guards';
```

### Routing Architecture Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/architecture/3-frontend-architecture.md]
**React Router Configuration:**

```typescript
// Router setup with TypeScript and protected routes
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Layout />,
    children: [
      { path: "/", element: <LandingPage /> },
      { path: "/login", element: <LoginPage /> },
      {
        path: "/dashboard",
        element: <ProtectedRoute><Dashboard /></ProtectedRoute>
      }
    ]
  }
])
```

**Route Guard Implementation:**

- Check authentication state before rendering protected routes
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login page
- Preserve intended destination for post-login navigation

### Build Configuration Requirements

[Source: vite.config.ts analysis, Epic requirements]
**Vite SPA Configuration:**

- Configure `historyApiFallback` for client-side routing
- Ensure production builds serve index.html for all routes
- Environment variable injection for Supabase configuration
- Integration with existing TypeScript and testing setup

**Quality Gate Integration:**

- All existing tests must pass with new routing context
- ESLint rules for React Router best practices
- TypeScript strict checking for route parameters and guards

### Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
**Router Testing Standards:**

- Test components wrapped in Router context
- Use MemoryRouter for isolated component testing
- Test route navigation and guard functionality
- Verify protected route authentication flow

**File Structure for Tests:**

- Router tests: `tests/routing/` (new directory)
- Integration tests with routing: existing `src/features/*/__tests__/*integration.test.*`
- Mock Supabase client for testing: `src/lib/__tests__/supabase.test.ts`

### Environment Variables Configuration

**Development Environment:**

```bash
# .env.local (for development)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_local_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_local_supabase_anon_key
```

**Integration with Existing Scripts:**

- Environment switching scripts will update these variables
- CI/CD workflows need access to test environment variables
- Production build requires production Supabase configuration

### Integration Points to Preserve

[Source: Epic Description, Story 1.1.1 insights]
**Critical Integrations:**

- **Vite Configuration**: Maintain existing React + TypeScript + Vitest setup
- **CI/CD Workflows**: GitHub Actions must work with environment variables
- **Quality Gates**: All pre-commit hooks and quality gates must pass
- **Development Scripts**: All npm scripts must work with routing changes
- **Build Process**: Production builds must support SPA routing properly

### Risk Mitigation Context

**Primary Risks:**

- Breaking existing development workflow during routing setup
- Supabase configuration conflicts with environment switching
- Production build routing issues with client-side navigation

**Mitigation Approach:**

- Test each integration point separately (Router, Supabase, Build)
- Verify environment switching works with new Supabase integration
- Ensure fallback routes work correctly in production builds

### Package.json Updates Required

**New Dependencies:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-router-dom": "^6.0.0",
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react-router-dom": "^5.3.0"
  }
}
```

**Script Verification:**

- Ensure all existing scripts work with new dependencies
- Test development server handles routing correctly
- Verify build process creates SPA-compatible output

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Router Testing Requirements:**

- Create `tests/routing/router.test.tsx` for route configuration testing
- Test protected route guards redirect unauthenticated users
- Test navigation between different route paths
- Mock Supabase authentication for route guard testing

**Integration Testing:**

- Test components render correctly within router context
- Verify environment variable loading in different environments
- Test Supabase client initialization and connection

**E2E Testing Preparation:**

- Ensure routing works with future Playwright E2E tests
- Add data-testid attributes to navigation elements
- Prepare routing for client management and authentication flows

**Test File Locations:**

- Router unit tests: `tests/routing/` (new directory)
- Supabase integration tests: `src/lib/__tests__/` (new directory)
- Component integration with router: existing feature test directories
