# Story 1.6: Reliable Logout Functionality

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** authenticated application user,
**I want** the logout button/link to work reliably every time I click it,
**so that** I can securely end my session and be redirected to the login page without confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Reliable Logout Action**: Logout button/link triggers logout process 100% of the time when clicked
2. **Session Termination**: User session is properly terminated on the server (Supabase Auth)
3. **UI State Clear**: Application UI state is cleared and auth context is reset
4. **Redirect Behavior**: User is immediately redirected to login page after successful logout
5. **Loading Feedback**: User sees loading indicator during logout process
6. **Error Handling**: If logout fails, user sees appropriate error message and can retry
7. **Double-Click Protection**: Multiple rapid clicks don't cause issues or errors
8. **Accessibility**: Logout button is accessible and provides proper feedback
9. **Existing Flow Preservation**: Other authentication flows continue to work unchanged

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 - Basic authentication established with auth-context.tsx managing user state, logout functionality exists but has reliability issues. Story 1.5 added error feedback patterns that can be reused for logout error handling.

### Relevant Source Tree Info
**Authentication Components:**
- `frontend/src/features/auth/auth-context.tsx` - Main auth context with logout function to fix
- `frontend/src/features/auth/use-auth.ts` - Hook that exposes logout functionality
- `frontend/src/app/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Likely contains logout button/link
- `frontend/src/lib/auth-guard.tsx` - Route protection that may need logout coordination

**UI Components:**
- Logout button location needs to be identified in dashboard or navigation
- May need to create dedicated logout button component for better state management

### Tech Stack Context
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Authentication**: @supabase/supabase-js with signOut method
- **State Management**: React Context for auth state management
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation and redirects

### Known Issues Analysis
Based on the problem description:
- **Intermittent Failure**: Logout sometimes doesn't work, suggesting async/timing issues
- **No UI Feedback**: User stays on same page without indication of what happened
- **State Management**: Possible race conditions in auth context state updates
- **Error Handling**: No visible error feedback when logout fails

### Key Integration Points
- **Supabase Auth**: Must properly call `supabase.auth.signOut()`
- **Auth Context**: State must be cleared and listeners notified
- **Router Navigation**: Redirect must happen after successful logout
- **UI State**: All user-specific data must be cleared from components

### Architecture Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing auth flow from Story 1.1
- Should follow error handling patterns established in Story 1.5
- Must not break protected route functionality in auth-guard.tsx
- Should reuse existing UI components and patterns

### Potential Root Causes
- Missing await on async logout operation
- Race condition between state update and redirect
- Supabase signOut() failing silently
- Component re-rendering issues during logout
- Missing error boundaries for logout failures

## Testing

### Testing Framework & Standards
- **Framework**: Vitest + @testing-library/react for unit/integration tests
- **Test Location**: Update existing `auth-context.test.tsx` and create logout-specific tests
- **Coverage**: Logout functionality must maintain >80% test coverage
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock Supabase auth signOut responses for both success and error scenarios

### Required Test Cases
```typescript
// Required test structure:
describe('Logout Functionality', () => {
  it('should successfully logout and redirect to login page')
  it('should handle Supabase signOut errors gracefully')
  it('should show loading indicator during logout process')
  it('should disable logout button during logout to prevent double-clicks')
  it('should clear all auth state after successful logout')
  it('should display error message for failed logout attempts')
  it('should allow retry after failed logout')
  it('should be accessible with proper ARIA attributes')
})
```

### Edge Case Testing
- **Network Issues**: Test logout with poor/no network connectivity
- **Session Expiry**: Test logout when session has already expired
- **Multiple Tabs**: Test logout behavior with multiple app tabs open
- **Rapid Clicks**: Test multiple rapid logout button clicks
- **Route Changes**: Test logout from different pages/routes

### Integration Testing Requirements
- **Auth Flow Integration**: Test logout in context of complete auth flow
- **Route Protection**: Verify protected routes work correctly after logout
- **State Persistence**: Ensure no user data persists after logout
- **Cross-Component**: Test logout from different components/pages

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test logout from dashboard page
- [ ] Test logout from different authenticated pages
- [ ] Test rapid clicking of logout button
- [ ] Test logout with slow network connection
- [ ] Test logout with network disconnected
- [ ] Verify redirect to login page works
- [ ] Verify no user data remains visible after logout
- [ ] Test logout accessibility with screen reader
- [ ] Test logout with keyboard navigation

### Debug Log References
- Initial analysis identified missing error handling and loading states in logout flow
- Race condition issues in auth state management were resolved with proper async/await handling
- Double-click protection implemented through loading state management
