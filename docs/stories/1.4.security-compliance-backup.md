# Story 1.4: Security Compliance & Backup Systems

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a therapist**, I want comprehensive backup, compliance, and advanced security controls so that my therapy practice data is protected, compliant with regulations, and I have complete control over security settings.

**Note:** This story continues the security implementation from [Story 1.3: Application Security & Data Protection](./1.3.application-security-data-protection.md), which completed core security features (session management, encryption, audit logging).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Compliance & Backup Features (Implementation Priority)

1. **Backup & Recovery Procedures**: Automated backup procedures and data recovery options are implemented
2. **Privacy Policy & Compliance Framework**: Privacy policy and security compliance measures are in place for healthcare-adjacent data
3. **Security Settings UI**: Therapists can manage all security preferences through intuitive interface
4. **Advanced Security Testing**: Comprehensive security validation ensures enterprise-grade protection

### Extended Acceptance Criteria

5. **GDPR/RODO Compliance**: EU region data storage and user rights implementation (data export, deletion)
6. **Backup Automation**: Scheduled backup procedures with recovery testing
7. **Security Dashboard**: Real-time security status and alerts for therapists
8. **Compliance Documentation**: Complete security and privacy documentation for audit purposes

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Security Foundation Built on Story 1.3:**

- Enhanced session management with timeout and refresh logic ✅
- AES-GCM field-level encryption for sensitive therapy data ✅
- Comprehensive audit logging (7 event types) ✅
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) ✅

### Key Technical Requirements

**Backup & Recovery (Supabase Integration):**

- Automated backup via Supabase Pro tier features
- Edge Functions for sensitive backup operations
- EU region data storage for GDPR compliance
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-authentication-security.md, docs/architecture/10-deployment-hosting.md]

**Compliance Framework:**

- GDPR/RODO compliance with EU region data storage
- Data export in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV)
- Data deletion with audit trail
- Consent management for data processing
- Privacy policy component integration
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-authentication-security.md]

**Security Settings UI:**

- Security settings panel: `src/features/auth/components/SecuritySettings.tsx`
- Security dashboard: `src/components/dashboard/SecurityDashboard.tsx`
- Privacy policy component: `src/components/legal/PrivacyPolicy.tsx`
- Integration with existing auth context and security service
  [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md, Story 1.3 implementation]

**Testing Requirements:**

- Security testing with Vitest specialized utilities
- Penetration testing scenarios for data protection
- Backup and recovery procedure testing
- Privacy compliance verification tests
- Integration with existing 58 security tests from Story 1.3
