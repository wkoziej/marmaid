# Story 1.1.2: Tooling Configuration Migration

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to configure TailwindCSS 4, ESLint + Prettier, and migrate testing configuration (Vitest + Playwright) to root directory,
**so that** we have complete tooling configuration in the root structure ready for systematic frontend development while maintaining all existing quality standards and integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Configure TailwindCSS 4 in root directory with proper PostCSS integration and match existing configuration patterns
2. Setup Prettier configuration in root directory with proper integration with ESLint
3. Migrate Playwright configuration from frontend/ subdirectory to root directory
4. Ensure all existing build processes and development workflows work correctly with new tooling configuration
5. Maintain all existing quality gates and testing infrastructure during configuration migration
6. Update package.json dependencies to include all required tooling packages
7. Verify integration with CI/CD workflows and ensure all quality gates continue to pass

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1.1 completion:

- Root structure migration successful with src/, public/, tests/ directories established
- Vite + React + TypeScript configuration working from root
- ESLint configuration (eslint.config.js) already in root and functional
- Vitest configuration integrated in vite.config.ts and working
- Package.json configured as main workspace with frontend/ preserved
- CI/CD pipeline updated to work with root structure

### Technology Stack Context

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Build System**: Vite 7.1.2 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (needs v4 configuration) + shadcn/ui components
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4 (already configured), Playwright 1.55.0 (needs migration), @testing-library/react 16.3.0
- **Code Quality**: ESLint (configured), Prettier (needs setup)
- **Environment Requirements**: Node.js >=18.0.0, NPM >=9.0.0

**Target Tooling Structure (after Story 1.1.2):**

```
[root]/
├── tailwind.config.js         # TailwindCSS 4 configuration
├── postcss.config.js          # PostCSS with TailwindCSS plugin

```

### Missing Tooling Dependencies

[Source: Current package.json analysis]
**Packages to Install:**

- **TailwindCSS 4**: `tailwindcss@latest`, `@tailwindcss/postcss@latest`, `autoprefixer@latest`
- **Prettier**: `prettier@latest`, `eslint-config-prettier@latest`, `eslint-plugin-prettier@latest`
- **Playwright**: `@playwright/test@latest`, `playwright@latest`

### File Naming and Import Conventions

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

- **Config Files**: kebab-case (tailwind.config.js, playwright.config.ts)
- **Absolute Imports**: Use `@/` from src root (import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button')
- **Style Files**: camelCase (globals.css, components.css)

### Integration Points to Preserve

[Source: Epic Description, Story 1.1.1 insights]

- **Vite Configuration**: Maintain Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest integration
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Ensure GitHub Actions workflows work with new tooling
- **Quality Gates**: Preserve all existing pre-commit hooks and quality gates
- **Development Scripts**: All npm scripts must work correctly with new tooling
- **ESLint Integration**: New Prettier config must work harmoniously with existing ESLint

### Configuration Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
**TailwindCSS Standards:**

- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes
- Organize CSS using Tailwind layers (@layer base, components, utilities)
- Configure for TypeScript/React component styling patterns

**Prettier Standards:**

- Integration with ESLint (no conflicting rules)
- TypeScript and React formatting support
- Consistent with existing code style from Story 1.1.1

**Playwright Standards:**

- Use `data-testid` attributes for stable E2E selectors (established pattern)
- Test file locations in tests/e2e/ directory
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline for E2E test execution

### Quality Gate Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/developer-workflow.md, Story 1.1.1 completion]
**Pre-commit Hook Integration:**

- ESLint + TypeScript checks (existing)
- Unit tests (existing via Vitest)
- Prettier formatting checks (new requirement)
- Coverage verification (existing)

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**

- All quality gates must pass in GitHub Actions
- Integration with multi-env-deploy.yml workflow
- E2E tests execution in CI environment
- Build optimization with TailwindCSS purging

### Environment-Specific Configuration Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/developer-workflow.md]

**Development Environment:**

- Hot module replacement with all tooling configurations
- Fast feedback for linting, formatting, and type checking
- TailwindCSS IntelliSense and development server integration

**Build Environment:**

- TailwindCSS optimization and purging for production builds
- Prettier formatting validation in CI/CD
- Playwright browser installation and E2E test execution

### Testing Standards

**File Structure for Tests:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards, Story 1.1.1 completion]

- Unit tests: `src/components/__tests__/`, `src/features/*/components/__tests__/` (existing)
- Integration tests: `src/features/*/__tests__/*integration.test.*` (existing)
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` (needs migration from frontend/ to root)

**Test Attribute Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

- Use `data-testid` attributes for stable E2E selectors
- Kebab-case naming: `data-testid="client-management-section"`
- Descriptive naming: `data-testid="login-submit-button"`

**Playwright Configuration Requirements:**

- Configure for TypeScript support
- Set up browser installation for CI/CD environments
- Configure for local development and CI execution
- Maintain existing test execution patterns

### Risk Mitigation Context

[Source: Epic 1.1 Risk Mitigation section]

- **Primary Risk**: Breaking development workflow during tooling configuration
- **Mitigation**: Incremental configuration - test each tool separately before integration
- **Approach**: Verify each configuration works independently, then test integrated workflow

### Package.json Script Updates

**New Scripts to Add:**

- `format`: "prettier --write ." - Format all files
- `format:check`: "prettier --check ." - Check formatting in CI
- `test:e2e`: "playwright test" - Run E2E tests from root

**Updated Scripts:**

- Ensure all existing scripts work with new tooling configuration
- Pre-commit integration with prettier formatting
