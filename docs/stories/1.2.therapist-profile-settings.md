## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established excellent foundations with:
- Robust authentication system using Supabase Auth with 93% test coverage
- Well-structured feature modules in `features/auth/` with TypeScript and Zod validation
- Professional UI components using shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS
- Secure session management and protected routes
- Comprehensive error handling and form validation patterns
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-setup-auth.md]

### Data Models
**Therapist Profile Structure:**
- Base user record in `users` table (id, email, role: 'therapist', created_at)
- Extended profile in `therapists` table (id -> users.id, profile, subscription_status)
- Profile JSON structure should include: name, credentials, practice_info, preferences, settings
- All therapist data protected by Row-Level Security (RLS) policies tied to auth.uid()
[Source: docs/architecture/4-backend-database-supabase.md#41-model-danych-propozycja-mvp]

**Therapy Schools Reference:**
- `schools` table (id, name, description) for therapy school options
- Therapist preferences link to school_id for default methodology selection
[Source: docs/architecture/4-backend-database-supabase.md#41-model-danych-propozycja-mvp]

### API Specifications
**Profile Management Endpoints:**
- GET/PUT `/therapists/{id}` - Profile CRUD operations through PostgREST (Supabase)
- GET `/schools` - Available therapy schools list
- Profile updates use Supabase client with automatic RLS enforcement
- All API calls through TanStack Query for caching and synchronization
[Source: docs/architecture/4-backend-database-supabase.md#42-api]

### Component Specifications
**File Locations:**
- Profile components in `frontend/src/features/auth/components/` (extending existing auth module)
- Profile hooks in `frontend/src/features/auth/hooks/` (useProfile, useUpdateProfile)
- Profile services in `frontend/src/features/auth/services/` (profileService.ts)
- Profile types in `frontend/src/features/auth/types.ts` (extending existing auth types)
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-project-structure]

**UI Component Requirements:**
- Use shadcn/ui base components (Button, Input, Label, Card, Select, Textarea)
- Follow established patterns from login/register forms in Story 1.1
- Implement responsive design with TailwindCSS utility classes
- Use cn() utility for conditional styling and component variants
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#styling-standards-tailwindcss--shadcnui]

### Form Implementation Patterns
**Validation Schema:**
- Zod schemas for profile data validation following established patterns
- TypeScript types inferred from Zod schemas (type ProfileFormData = z.infer<typeof profileSchema>)
- React Hook Form integration with zodResolver for form handling
- Proper error messaging and validation feedback
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#form-standards-react-hook-form--zod]

**Example Schema Structure:**
```typescript
const profileSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, 'Name must be at least 2 characters'),
  credentials: z.string().optional(),
  practice_info: z.string().optional(),
  therapy_school_id: z.string().uuid('Invalid school selection'),
  ui_preferences: z.object({
    theme: z.enum(['light', 'dark', 'system']),
    language: z.string().default('en')
  })
})
```
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#form-standards-react-hook-form--zod]

### State Management
**Profile State Handling:**
- Extend existing auth context or create dedicated profile store using Zustand
- Cache profile data using TanStack Query with proper cache invalidation
- Optimistic updates for better user experience during profile modifications
- Integration with existing auth state for seamless user experience
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#state-management-zustand]

### Security Requirements
**Profile Data Protection:**
- All profile modifications require authenticated user session
- Therapist can only modify their own profile (enforced by RLS)
- Sensitive information (credentials, practice details) stored securely
- Password changes integrate with Supabase Auth security protocols
[Source: docs/architecture/4-backend-database-supabase.md#43-rls-row-level-security]

### Testing Requirements
**Test Coverage Standards:**
- Unit tests for profile components using React Testing Library
- Form validation testing with various input scenarios
