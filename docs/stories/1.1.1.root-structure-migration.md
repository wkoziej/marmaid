# Story 1.1.1: Root Structure Migration

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to move Vite + React + TypeScript configuration from `frontend/` subdirectory to root directory and establish clean directory structure (`src/`, `public/`, `tests/`),
**so that** we have a foundation for systematic frontend rebuilding while maintaining all existing quality standards and integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Move all Vite configuration files (`vite.config.ts`, `index.html`) from `frontend/` to root directory
2. Relocate all React + TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`) to root
3. Create clean directory structure in root with `src/`, `public/`, `tests/` directories
4. Update `package.json` to be the main project package file in root directory
5. Update NPM workspace configuration to support root-based frontend structure
6. Ensure all existing build processes work correctly from root directory
7. Maintain all existing quality gates and testing infrastructure during migration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 1.1, so no previous story context applies.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Current Tech Stack**: React 19, Vite 7.1.2, TypeScript 5.8.3, TailwindCSS 4.1.12
- **Build System**: Vite with `@vitejs/plugin-react` 5.0.0
- **Environment Requirements**: Node.js >=18.0.0, NPM >=9.0.0
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4, Playwright 1.55.0, @testing-library/react 16.3.0

### Current Project Structure Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
**Current Structure (to be migrated):**
```
frontend/
├── public/                     # Static assets

│   └── main.tsx               # App entry point
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── [other config files]
```

**Target Structure (after migration):**
```
[root]/

```

### NPM Workspace Configuration
[Source: Current root package.json]
- **Current Workspace**: `"workspaces": ["frontend"]` 
- **Target Workspace**: Remove frontend workspace, make root the main package location
- **Workspace Scripts**: Root package.json currently delegates to frontend/ subdirectory

### File Naming and Import Conventions
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Components**: PascalCase (`LoginForm.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAuth.ts`)
- **Imports**: Absolute imports using `@/` from src root
- **Example**: `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`

### Build and Development Process
[Source: frontend/package.json scripts]
**Scripts to preserve in root package.json:**
- `dev`: "vite" - Development server
- `build`: "tsc -b && vite build" - Production build
- `lint`: "eslint ." - Linting
- `preview`: "vite preview" - Preview build
- `test`: "vitest" - Unit testing
- `test:e2e`: "playwright test" - E2E testing
- `typecheck`: "tsc --noEmit" - Type checking

### Quality Gates and Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, frontend/package.json]
**Testing Infrastructure to maintain:**
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with jsdom, @testing-library/react
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright with data-testid selectors
- **Coverage**: @vitest/coverage-v8 with coverage thresholds
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks, quality-gates.js script
- **Test Types**: Unit, Integration, E2E test separation

### Risk Mitigation Context
[Source: Epic 1.1 Risk Mitigation section]
- **Primary Risk**: Breaking CI/CD pipeline and development workflow
- **Mitigation**: Keep `frontend/` intact until root structure verified working
- **Approach**: Parallel development - create root structure first, then remove frontend/ once verified

### Integration Points to Preserve
[Source: Epic Description]
- **Supabase Client Configuration**: Maintain existing client setup in lib/
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Ensure GitHub Actions workflows continue to work
- **Environment Variables**: Preserve `.env` file configurations
- **Development Scripts**: Root scripts must work equivalently to current frontend/ scripts

### Testing Standards
**Test Attribute Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Use `data-testid` attributes for stable E2E selectors
- Test file locations: Unit tests co-located with components, E2E tests in tests/ directory
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- Coverage requirements: Maintain existing coverage thresholds

**File Structure for Tests:**
- Unit tests: `src/components/__tests__/`, `src/features/*/components/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `src/features/*/__tests__/*integration.test.*`  
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` (new directory in root)

### Environment-Specific Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/developer-workflow.md, docs/architecture/environments.md]

**Development Environment Tests:**
- **Unit Tests**: Must run locally with `npm run test` using Vitest + jsdom
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: ESLint, TypeScript checks, unit tests, coverage verification
- **Local Integration**: Tests run against local Supabase (Docker) via `npm run dev`
- **Fast Feedback**: < 30 seconds for local test execution

**Test Environment Integration:**
[Source: docs/architecture/deployment-setup.md]
- **Integration Tests**: Run against test Supabase instance (`myxicttnpflkwnofbhci.supabase.co`)
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions trigger tests on PR to main
- **Migration Testing**: Automatic database migration testing in test environment
- **Environment Isolation**: Tests use `.env.test` configuration

**CI/CD Testing Pipeline:**
[Source: docs/architecture/developer-workflow.md]
```
Pull Request to main:
  - All unit tests
  - Integration tests (if Supabase credentials available)
  - E2E tests (critical paths)
  - Quality gates (linting, typecheck, coverage)

Push to test branch:
  - Deploy to TEST environment
  - Apply migrations to TEST database
  - Run integration tests against TEST

Production Deployment:
  - Smoke tests
  - Health checks
  - Rollback capability
```

**Testing Scripts to Preserve:**
- `npm run test` - Unit tests (development)
- `npm run test:integration` - Integration tests (development + test env)
- `npm run test:e2e` - E2E tests (Playwright)
- `npm run test:local` - Full local test suite via `scripts/run-local-tests.sh`

**Quality Gate Requirements:**
- Pre-commit hooks must run from root directory
- GitHub Actions workflows must detect root-based test structure
- Coverage thresholds must be maintained across all test types
- Integration with Supabase environments must work seamlessly
