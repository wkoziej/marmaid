# Story 1.1.1: Root Structure Migration

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to move Vite + React + TypeScript configuration from `frontend/` subdirectory to root directory and establish clean directory structure (`src/`, `public/`, `tests/`),
**so that** we have a foundation for systematic frontend rebuilding while maintaining all existing quality standards and integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Move all Vite configuration files (`vite.config.ts`, `index.html`) from `frontend/` to root directory
2. Relocate all React + TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`) to root
3. Create clean directory structure in root with `src/`, `public/`, `tests/` directories
4. Update `package.json` to be the main project package file in root directory
5. Update NPM workspace configuration to support root-based frontend structure
6. Ensure all existing build processes work correctly from root directory
7. Maintain all existing quality gates and testing infrastructure during migration

```

### NPM Workspace Configuration

[Source: Current root package.json]

- **Current Workspace**: `"workspaces": ["frontend"]`
- **Target Workspace**: Remove frontend workspace, make root the main package location
- **Workspace Scripts**: Root package.json currently delegates to frontend/ subdirectory

### File Naming and Import Conventions

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Components**: PascalCase (`LoginForm.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAuth.ts`)
- **Imports**: Absolute imports using `@/` from src root
- **Example**: `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`

### Build and Development Process

[Source: frontend/package.json scripts]
**Scripts to preserve in root package.json:**

- `dev`: "vite" - Development server
- `build`: "tsc -b && vite build" - Production build
- `lint`: "eslint ." - Linting
- `preview`: "vite preview" - Preview build
- `test`: "vitest" - Unit testing
- `test:e2e`: "playwright test" - E2E testing
- `typecheck`: "tsc --noEmit" - Type checking

### Quality Gates and Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, frontend/package.json]
**Testing Infrastructure to maintain:**

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with jsdom, @testing-library/react
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright with data-testid selectors
- **Coverage**: @vitest/coverage-v8 with coverage thresholds
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks, quality-gates.js script
- **Test Types**: Unit, Integration, E2E test separation

### Risk Mitigation Context

[Source: Epic 1.1 Risk Mitigation section]

- **Primary Risk**: Breaking CI/CD pipeline and development workflow
- **Mitigation**: Keep `frontend/` intact until root structure verified working
- **Approach**: Parallel development - create root structure first, then remove frontend/ once verified

### Integration Points to Preserve

[Source: Epic Description]

- **Supabase Client Configuration**: Maintain existing client setup in lib/
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Ensure GitHub Actions workflows continue to work
- **Environment Variables**: Preserve `.env` file configurations
- **Development Scripts**: Root scripts must work equivalently to current frontend/ scripts

### Testing Standards

**Test Attribute Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

- Use `data-testid` attributes for stable E2E selectors
- Test file locations: Unit tests co-located with components, E2E tests in tests/ directory
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- Coverage requirements: Maintain existing coverage thresholds

**File Structure for Tests:**

- Unit tests: `src/components/__tests__/`, `src/features/*/components/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `src/features/*/__tests__/*integration.test.*`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` (new directory in root)

### Environment-Specific Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/developer-workflow.md, docs/architecture/environments.md]

**Development Environment Tests:**

- **Unit Tests**: Must run locally with `npm run test` using Vitest + jsdom
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: ESLint, TypeScript checks, unit tests, coverage verification
- **Local Integration**: Tests run against local Supabase (Docker) via `npm run dev`
- **Fast Feedback**: < 30 seconds for local test execution

**Test Environment Integration:**
[Source: docs/architecture/deployment-setup.md]

- **Integration Tests**: Run against test Supabase instance (`myxicttnpflkwnofbhci.supabase.co`)
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions trigger tests on PR to main
- **Migration Testing**: Automatic database migration testing in test environment
- **Environment Isolation**: Tests use `.env.test` configuration

**CI/CD Testing Pipeline:**
[Source: docs/architecture/developer-workflow.md]

```
Pull Request to main:
  - All unit tests
  - Integration tests (if Supabase credentials available)
  - E2E tests (critical paths)
  - Quality gates (linting, typecheck, coverage)

Push to test branch:
  - Deploy to TEST environment
  - Apply migrations to TEST database
  - Run integration tests against TEST

Production Deployment:
  - Smoke tests
  - Health checks
  - Rollback capability
```

**Testing Scripts to Preserve:**

- `npm run test` - Unit tests (development)
- `npm run test:integration` - Integration tests (development + test env)
- `npm run test:e2e` - E2E tests (Playwright)
- `npm run test:local` - Full local test suite via `scripts/run-local-tests.sh`

**Quality Gate Requirements:**

- Pre-commit hooks must run from root directory
- GitHub Actions workflows must detect root-based test structure
- Coverage thresholds must be maintained across all test types
- Integration with Supabase environments must work seamlessly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The root structure migration has been **successfully implemented** with all acceptance criteria met. The migration creates a clean foundation for systematic frontend rebuilding. However, during review I discovered **CRITICAL BUGS** in the CI/CD workflow that would have caused production deployment failures.

### Refactoring Performed

I performed the following critical fixes during review:

- **File**: `.github/workflows/multi-env-deploy.yml`
  - **Change**: Fixed 5 critical path references from `frontend/` to root structure
  - **Why**: Production deployment would fail trying to access non-existent `frontend/dist` paths
  - **How**: Updated workflow to use root `dist/`, corrected working directory, and fixed cache paths

- **File**: `src/App.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed TypeScript ESLint error for `any` type usage
  - **Why**: Quality gates were failing due to linting error
  - **How**: Used proper TypeScript type assertion `global as unknown as { __GIT_INFO__: object }`

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean structure, proper naming conventions followed
- Project Structure: ✓ All required directories created (src/, public/, tests/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests working, coverage for landing page functionality
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria successfully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[All critical items addressed during review]

- [x] Fixed critical CI/CD workflow bugs (5 path errors corrected)
- [x] Resolved ESLint TypeScript compliance issue
- [x] Verified all quality gates pass (test, lint, typecheck, build)
- [x] Confirmed clean directory structure established
- [x] Validated NPM workspace configuration preserved
- [ ] Consider adding test coverage reporting for future stories
- [ ] Add integration tests for frontend/root routing when main app is integrated

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This is a structural migration with no security-sensitive functionality changes.

### Performance Considerations

Bundle size optimized at 188KB (well under 1MB limit for landing page). Git info injection working correctly for version tracking.

### Files Modified During Review

**CRITICAL**: I modified files to fix deployment-breaking bugs:

- `.github/workflows/multi-env-deploy.yml` - Fixed 5 critical path references
- `src/App.test.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript/ESLint compliance issue

**Developer must update File List to include these QA fixes.**

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.1.1-root-structure-migration.yml

**Reason**: Migration successful but contained critical CI/CD bugs that could have caused production failures. Bugs were fixed during review.

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met, critical bugs fixed during review, all quality gates passing.

Story owner should verify CI/CD pipeline in development branch before final completion.
