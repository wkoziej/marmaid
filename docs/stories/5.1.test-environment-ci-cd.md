# Story 5.1: Test Environment Setup & CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
Ready for Implementation

## Story
**As a development team**, I want a dedicated test environment with automated deployment pipeline so that I can continuously validate features like therapist profile management (Story 1.2) before production release.

## Acceptance Criteria

### MVP Core Features (Implementation Priority)
1. **Test Environment Creation**: Dedicated Supabase test project with isolated database and authentication
2. **Database Migration Automation**: Automated execution of migrations (including therapists table from Story 1.2) in test environment  
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Automated deployment from develop branch with test execution
4. **Test Data Management**: Consistent test data seeding for therapist profiles and authentication testing
5. **Quality Gates**: Automated test execution (69 tests from Story 1.2) with deployment blocking on failures

### Post-MVP Features (Deferred)
- **Branch Preview Deployments**: Automatic preview environments for feature branches (Story 5.1.1)
- **Performance Testing**: Automated performance benchmarks in CI pipeline (Story 5.1.2)  
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in deployment pipeline (Story 5.3)
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Test environment monitoring and alerting (Story 5.4)

## Dev Notes

### Dependencies from Previous Stories
Story 1.2 provides critical foundation elements:
- Database migration scripts (`supabase-migration-therapists-table.sql`)  
- Comprehensive test suite (69 tests) for validation
- Frontend build configuration with Vite
- Environment-specific Supabase client configuration
- RLS policies that must be replicated in test environment
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.therapist-profile-settings.md, docs/qa/gates/1.2-therapist-profile-settings.yml]

### Infrastructure Architecture
**Test Environment Components:**
- **Supabase Test Project**: Isolated instance with separate database and auth
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify deployment linked to test Supabase
- **Database Schema**: Automated migration execution with `users` and `therapists` tables
- **Test Data**: Seeded therapist profiles for consistent testing scenarios
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions with deployment automation

**Environment Isolation Strategy:**
- Separate Supabase projects (dev → test → prod)
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Isolated authentication pools
- Test data that doesn't interfere with development
[Source: docs/architecture/4-backend-database-supabase.md]

### CI/CD Pipeline Specifications
**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript compilation, code formatting
2. **Test Execution**: Unit tests (29), integration tests (8), component tests (12)
3. **Build Process**: Vite production build with test environment config
4. **Database Migration**: Automated migration execution in test Supabase
5. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to test environment
6. **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification post-deployment

**Quality Gates (MVP):**
- All 69 tests must pass before deployment
- Build must complete without errors  
- Database migrations must execute successfully
[Source: Epic 1 testing standards, docs/qa/gates/1.2-therapist-profile-settings.yml]

### Environment Configuration
**Supabase Test Project Setup:**
- Test project creation with dedicated URL and keys
- RLS policies replication from development
- Migration scripts execution for therapists table
- Authentication configuration for test users
- API rate limiting appropriate for test load

**Frontend Configuration:**
- Environment variables for test Supabase connection
- Build configuration optimized for testing
- Error tracking configuration (non-production)  
- Feature flags for test-specific behavior
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md, docs/architecture/3-frontend-architecture.md]

### Test Data Management
**Seed Data Strategy:**
- Test therapist profiles with various profile states
- Authentication test users with known credentials
- Edge case data for validation testing
- Clean data state for each test run

**Data Management Requirements:**
- Automated data seeding in CI pipeline
- Data cleanup between test runs
- Consistent data state for reliable testing
- No PII or production data in test environment

### Deployment Automation
**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- Trigger on push to develop branch
- Parallel execution of tests and build
- Sequential deployment with rollback capability
- Notification on deployment success/failure
- Integration with Slack/email for team updates

**Deployment Safety:**
- Health checks post-deployment
- Automatic rollback on critical failures  
- Deployment status reporting
- Manual promotion gates for critical changes
[Source: Epic 5 deployment safety requirements]

### Testing

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Testing**: GitHub Actions workflow validation with test deployments
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Supabase test environment connectivity and functionality
- **Database Migration Testing**: Automated migration execution and rollback in isolated environment
- **Integration Testing**: Existing Epic 1.2 components function correctly in test environment
- **Deployment Testing**: End-to-end deployment pipeline execution

**Test Execution Strategy:**
- **Automated Test Suite**: 69 existing tests from Epic 1.2 execute in CI pipeline
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Test environment isolation and security verification
- **Data Seeding Validation**: Consistent test data creation and cleanup
- **Pipeline Failure Testing**: Quality gates block deployment on failures
- **Rollback Testing**: Deployment rollback procedures validation

**Test File Locations:**
- CI/CD configuration: `.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml`
- Infrastructure tests: `tests/infrastructure/`
- Migration tests: `tests/database/migration.test.js`
- Integration tests: extending existing `src/features/auth/__tests__/`

## Acceptance Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Automated Deployment Success (MVP Core)
- Developer pushes code change to develop branch with new therapist profile feature
- CI pipeline executes all 69 tests and builds application successfully  
- Database migration runs automatically in test environment
- Application deploys to test environment with new functionality
- Test data seeding completes and therapist profiles are accessible
- Deployment notification confirms successful completion

### Scenario 2: Quality Gate Enforcement (MVP Core)
- Developer pushes code with failing tests to develop branch
- CI pipeline detects test failures (e.g., profile validation test fails)
- Quality gates block deployment to test environment
- Development team receives notification of deployment failure
- Test environment remains stable with previous working version
- Developer fixes tests and re-triggers successful deployment

### Scenario 3: Database Migration and Data Consistency (MVP Core) 
- Database schema change (e.g., new therapist profile field) pushed to develop
- Migration executes automatically in test environment
- Existing test data remains intact and accessible
- New schema changes are reflected in test environment
- RLS policies continue to function correctly
- Test suite validates new and existing functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 5 MVP acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Test environment operational with isolated Supabase instance
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys from develop branch
- [ ] All 69 tests from Story 1.2 execute automatically in pipeline
- [ ] Database migrations execute automatically with proper rollback procedures
- [ ] Test data seeding functional with consistent, reliable data
- [ ] Quality gates enforce test success before deployment
- [ ] Documentation complete for deployment procedures and troubleshooting
- [ ] Integration tested with existing Epic 1 functionality
- [ ] Foundation ready for Stories 5.2 (Production) and 5.3 (Security)

## Technical Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk**: Integration complexity with existing Supabase setup and test execution
**Dependencies**: Requires completion of Epic 1.2 (therapists table and tests)
**Complexity**: Medium - standard CI/CD patterns with Supabase-specific considerations

## Integration Points with Epic 1
- **Story 1.2 Database**: therapists table migration must deploy to test environment
- **Story 1.2 Tests**: 69 existing tests become validation suite for CI/CD  
- **Story 1.2 Frontend**: profile management components must function in test environment
- **Future Epic 1.3**: security features will extend this test environment foundation
