# Story 2.2: Therapy Session History & Progress Tracking

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a therapist, I want to record and review detailed session notes and therapy progress so that I can track what treatments were applied and their effectiveness over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Session Note Creation:**
   - Create session notes with date, time, and duration fields
   - Record detailed treatment descriptions and interventions used
   - Document client response and immediate outcomes
   - Support rich text formatting for comprehensive notes

2. **Progress Tracking System:**
   - Rate therapy session effectiveness on standardized scale (1-5)
   - Track specific therapy outcome metrics (mood, behavior, engagement)
   - Document progress toward client's therapeutic goals
   - Record setbacks or challenges encountered during session

3. **Historical Data Management:**
   - View chronological timeline of all client sessions
   - Access session-to-session comparison views
   - Generate progress visualization charts and graphs
   - Export historical session data for external analysis

4. **Session Templates:**
   - Create reusable session documentation templates
   - Apply templates for consistent documentation structure
   - Customize templates based on therapy type or client needs
   - Share templates across similar client cases

5. **Data Integration:**
   - Link session notes to specific client profiles (from Story 2.1)
   - Associate sessions with therapy goals and treatment plans
   - Connect progress metrics to overall client outcome tracking
   - Maintain data integrity across client management system

### Technical Requirements

6. **Database Design:**
   - Implement sessions table with proper foreign key relationships
   - Create progress_metrics table for standardized outcome tracking
   - Design session_templates table for reusable documentation
   - Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) for therapist data isolation

7. **User Interface:**
   - Intuitive session entry form with validation
   - Interactive timeline view for session history
   - Progress visualization with charts and trend lines
   - Mobile-responsive design for tablet/phone access

8. **Performance & Security:**
   - Session data loads within 1 second for 100+ sessions
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive therapy notes
   - Audit trail for all session data modifications
   - Automated backup of session records

### Context for Dev Agent

This story builds directly on Story 2.1 (Client Profile Creation) and requires:

- Integration with existing client data structures
- Supabase database expansion with new tables
- Rich text editing capabilities for therapy notes
- Data visualization for progress tracking
- Mobile-responsive design for field use

The therapy session tracking system is core to the MVP value proposition, enabling therapists to maintain professional-grade documentation and improve treatment outcomes through data-driven insights.

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Database Design:** Use PostgreSQL JSON columns for flexible session metadata
- **Rich Text Editor:** Implement TipTap or similar for therapy note formatting
- **Progress Visualization:** Utilize Chart.js or D3.js for progress charts
- **Mobile Strategy:** Progressive Web App approach for offline session entry
